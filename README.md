# Udacity-Online-DVD-Rental-SQL-Project

This project investigate a relational database about Online DVD Rentals.

I have answered FOUR question using SQL thin Visualize the outpot using MS Excel

The question are:

Q1/ Create a query that lists each movie, the film category it is classified in, and the number of times it has been rented out.

Q2/ Can you provide a table with the movie titles and divide them into 4 levels (first_quarter, second_quarter, third_quarter, and final_quarter) based on the quartiles (25%, 50%, 75%) of the rental duration for movies across all categories? Make sure to also indicate the category that these family-friendly movies fall into.

Q3/ Finally, provide a table with the family-friendly film category, each of the quartiles, and the corresponding count of movies within each combination of film category for each corresponding rental duration category. The resulting table should have three columns:
Category
Rental length category
Count

Q4/ We want to find out how the two stores compare in their count of rental orders during every month for all the years we have data for. Write a query that returns the store ID for the store, the year and month and the number of rental orders each store has fulfilled for that month. Your table should include a column for each of the following: year, month, store ID and count of rental orders fulfilled during that month.
